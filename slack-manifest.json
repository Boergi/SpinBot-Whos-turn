Perfect for deciding who has to pre-order lunch, get coffee, or take on any other task. Simply mention @SpinBot in a thread with your task description, and it will randomly pick someone from thread participants (including those who just reacted with 👍, ➕, or ✅). Also works in channels for team-wide selection with smart status filtering."
