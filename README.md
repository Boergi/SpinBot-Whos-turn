# SpinBot - Who's Turn? 🎲

A Slack bot that randomly selects a user from a thread to decide who has to perform a specific task.

> 📣 **Important:** Use `@SpinBot` in threads, not `/spinbot`. Slack doesn't support slash commands in threads. See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) if upgrading from an older version.

> ⚖️ **License Notice:** This software is free for personal, educational, and internal business use. Commercial use, resale, or redistribution for profit is **NOT** permitted. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.

## Example Usage

### In a Thread
**Mention the bot in a thread:**
```
@SpinBot who has to pre-order lunch?
```
or
```
@SpinBot wer muss essen vorbestellen?
```

**Response:**
```
🎲 @Username has to pre-order lunch
```

The bot selects randomly from **thread participants**.

### Directly in a Channel
**Mention the bot directly in the channel (max 20 members):**
```
@SpinBot who moderates today's daily?
```
or
```
@SpinBot wer moderiert heute das Daily?
```

**Response:**
```
🎲 @Username moderates today's daily
```

The bot selects randomly from **all channel members** (excluding users with specific status emojis).

> ⚠️ **Note:** Channel-level selection only works in channels with up to 20 members. For larger channels, use the bot in a thread instead.

> 💡 **Note:** You can use "who" or "wer" at the beginning and add a "?" at the end - the bot will automatically clean it up for the output!

   ```
   
   > 💡 To find a User ID: Right-click user → View Profile → More → Copy Member ID
   
   > 💡 Status filtering only applies when using SpinBot directly in a channel with max 20 members. In threads, all participants are eligible.

3. Run migrations to create tables:

See [DATABASE.md](DATABASE.md) for detailed setup and usage information.

> 💡 **Note:** The bot works without a database, but you won't have usage statistics.

### 9. Start Bot

```bash
npm start
```

For development with auto-reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage

### In Threads (Primary Usage)

1. Create a message in a Slack channel
2. Have other users reply to this message in a thread
3. In the thread, mention the bot with a task description:
   ```
   @SpinBot <task description>
   ```

**Examples:**
```
@SpinBot who has to pre-order lunch?
@SpinBot wer muss Kaffee holen?
@SpinBot who is up for cleaning?
@SpinBot wer muss das nächste Meeting moderieren?
```

The bot randomly selects one of the users from the thread and returns:
```
🎲 @Username <task description>
```

### In Channels (Alternative)

You can also use the slash command in the main channel:
```
/spinbot has to pre-order lunch
```

The bot will provide instructions on how to use it properly in threads.
